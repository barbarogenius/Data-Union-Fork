# Data Union fork: Tools for data strike

These are still early days before the full implications and range of uses and environments that the blockchain technology can affect and be affected by are known. In anticipation of these implications, we believe that there is enough evidence of a need for mass organised collective action regarding data: to defend and manage personal and population-wide data. This organisation should come ‘from below’. Data Union fork → tools for data strike is an idea building on [DECODE OS](https://github.com/DECODEproject/decode-os), blockchain-based, operating system and nodes for decentralised ownership and control of data. It is a proposal to conceptualise, articulate and co-create an assertive “smart contract” model enabling additional protective layer for citizens’ digital rights whilst promoting solidarity and mutual aid.
